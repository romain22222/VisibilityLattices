  Dear editors

  Please find enclosed our paper

  ``Visibility on digitized shapes and convergence of a normal estimator''

  which we submit to the JMIV special issue on Discrete Geometry and
  Mathematical Morphology. It is the extension of our DGMM2025 paper
  "Fast and exact visibility on digitized shapes and application to saliency-aware normal estimation".

  As announced in our expression of interest message, we have extended
  the paper along the following lines:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We have added proofs regarding the convergence of the normal estimator on digitized smooth surfaces.
    \item In order to add those proofs, we updated the definition of the visibility, now named "$k$-visibility",
      which is more general and allows to control the regularity of the visibility cone. We have also added a
      discussion regarding this new definition and its relation to the original one.
    \item We improved experiments to analyze the behavior of the normal estimator on piecewise-smooth surfaces and
      with different kernels (uniform, gaussian, ring). and compared it with other normal estimators.
    \item We have added some illustrations regarding piecewise-smooth surfaces studies alongside reworking older ones.
    \item The paper is now // TODO CHECK PAGES-17-18 // pages long in 2-column format.
  \end{itemize}

  We believe this extended version of our paper will be a valuable
  contribution to the JMIV special issue, and we look forward to hearing
  from you soon.

  Best regards
  \bigskip
