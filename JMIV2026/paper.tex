\abstract{Determining visibility between points on a digital surface
  is essential for analyzing the surface local geometry in a
  parameter-free manner. However computating visibility requires heavy
  computations since it must identify pairs of points that are visible
  to each other, i.e. there is a straight segment joining them that
  stays in the close vicinity of the surface.  We propose to
  exploit a specific representation of digital sets based on lists of
  integral intervals in order to compute efficiently the complete
  visibility graph between lattice points of the digital shape. As a
  quite direct application, we show then how we can use visibility to
  estimate the normal vector field of a digital shape in an accurate
  and convergent manner while staying aware of the salient and sharp
  features of the shape. Under the right hypotheses, the convergence
  speed is in $O(\sqrt{h})$, for $h$ the digitization gridstep.
