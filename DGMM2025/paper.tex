    \begin{abstract}
        Computing visibility on a geometric object requires heavy
        computations since it requires to identify pairs of points that
        are visible to each other, i.e.\ there is a straight segment
        joining them that stays in the close vicinity of the object
        boundary. We propose to exploit a specific representation of
        digital sets based on lists of integral intervals in order to
        compute efficiently the complete visibility graph between
        lattice points of the digital shape. As a quite direct
        application, we show then how we can use visibility to estimate
        the normal vector field of a digital shape in an accurate and
        convergent manner while staying aware of the salient and sharp features of
        the shape.
