    \begin{abstract}
        Computing visibility on a geometric object requires heavy
        computations since it requires to identify pairs of points that
        are visible to each other, i.e.\ there is a straight segment
        joining them that stays in the close vicinity of the object
        boundary. We propose to exploit a specific representation of
        digital sets based on lists of integral intervals in order to
        compute efficiently the complete visibility graph between
        lattice points of the digital shape. As a quite direct
        application, we show then how we can use visibility to estimate
        the normal vector field of a digital shape in an accurate and
        convergent manner while staying aware of the salient and sharp features of
        the shape.

    \section{Saliency-aware normal and curvature estimation}

    \newcommand{\Kernel}[1]{\ensuremath{w_{\sigma}(#1)}}

    \paragraph{Saliency-aware normal estimator.}
    We propose a new normal estimator on digital surfaces, which uses
    the visibility of the point of interest while taking into account
    a user-given scale $\sigma$. If $\sigma$ is proportionnal to the
    average length between visible points (so some
    $\Theta\left(\sqrt{h}\right)$), then this estimator is observed to be
    multigrid convergent along digitization of smooth shapes. However,
    since the computation window is limited by the visibility, it
    better approximates the geometry near sharp or salient features.

    More precisely, we choose a Gaussian function
    $\Kernel{x}\coloneqq e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ as a weight kernel. Let
    $V_p$ be the set of visible points from the point $p$. Let $c_p$
    be the weighted centroid of the visible points around $p$,
    i.e. $c_p \coloneqq \frac{\sum_{q \in V_p} \Kernel{\|q-p\|}q}{\sum_{q \in
    V_p} \Kernel{\|q-p\|}}$. We form the weighted covariance matrix
    $\mathcal{V}_p$ of the points $V_p$ as:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{V}_p = \sum_{q \in V_p} \Kernel{\|q-p\|}(q - c_p)(q - c_p)^T.
    \end{equation}
    The \emph{visibility normal} $\vec{n}(p)$ of point $p$ at scale $\sigma$ is defined
    as the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix $\mathcal{V}_p$
    of the visible points, corresponding to its smallest
    eigenvalue. Its orientation is chosen to point in the same
    direction as the average of the trivial normals to the surfels
    touching the point $p$.


    \paragraph{Experimental validation.} [TO COMPLETE]
    Figure~\ref{fig:normals-estimation} shows an example
    of our normals compared to normals computed with the integral invariant (II) estimator~\cite{Lachaud:2017-lnm}.

    %% Then, to compute the curvatures, we use the Corrected Normal Current
    %% estimator~\cite{lachaud:2022-dcg} which are based on the normals computed
    %% above.

    \paragraph{Application to curvature estimation.}
    In order to illustrate better that the visibility normals better
    take into account the sharp features of a digital surface while
    staying meaningfull in digitization of smooth parts, we compare
    the curvature estimates induced by different discrete normal
    estimators. We exploit the \emph{Corrected Normal Current (CNC)
        estimator}, whose theory is detailed in~\cite{lachaud:2022-dcg}
    and which can estimate all kinds of curvatures given positions and
    normals. It produces state-of-the-art curvature estimates on
    polygonal surfaces~\cite{lachaud:2020-cgf}, point clouds~\cite{lachaud:2023-cgf}, and even outperforms Integral Invariant
    curvature estimates~\cite{coeurjolly:2014-cviu} on digital
    surfaces~\cite{lachaud:2022-dcg}. Its implementation is also
    available in    \href{https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleCurvatureMeasures.html}{\textsc{DGtal}}.

    Figure~\ref{fig:fig-curvatures} displays the results of CNC curvature
    estimations on the digitization of a piecewise smooth shape
    ``Talking D20'', taken from
    \href{https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/detail.html?file_id=1533028}{Thingi10K}.
    We compare the differences obtained by just changing the discrete
    normal estimator (available in the \textsc{DGtal} library):
    (column II normals) Integral Invariant normals with $r=6$, (column
    CTriv normals) convolved trivial normals with $r=6$, (column
    Visibility normals) our proposed estimator (VN) with $\sigma=4$ and
    maximal visibility distance $2\sigma$. These parameters were
    chosen so that the respective computation windows of the different
    estimators are approximately the same.

    The II estimator is good along digitization of smooth or flat parts of
    the dice, but presents curious artefacts near sharp features
    induced by the hollowed out numbers: this is due to the nature of
    II normal estimates, which computes a PCA of a ball centered on
    the point of interest and may include points on the other side of
    the saliencies.

    The CTriv estimator only performs averaging of trivial normal
    directions along the surface. It behaves much better than II near
    features (although it tends to smooth curvatures) since it does
    not use information from across the gap. However some oscillations
    of the curvatures are distinguishable especially along the flat
    parts, and some curvature estimates are erroneous on smoother
    parts (like the edge above 6 for $\kappa_2$ or several dice
    vertices).

    The VN estimator takes the best of the two previous approaches. It
    remains precise and stable on smooth and flat regions, while
    perfectly delineating sharp features and holes, whatever the kind
    of estimated curvatures. Its drawback is the computation time,
    which is $52s$ for a maximal visibility distance $8$, compared to
    $2.3$s for II and $0.1s$ for CTriv. Note that the computation time
    falls back to $33s$ for a maximal distance of $6$ (and same
    $\sigma=4$) while the result is visually indistinguishable.
